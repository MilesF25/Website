Hi welcome to my website. I will be updating it from time to time with details of my work.

## Software Engineering Book

#### Summary

The book is about the concept of software engineering and its broader scope. The book talks about not just coding but also the tools and processes used to develop and maintain code over time. It raises questions about how programmers can maintain code and good coding practice to ensure that the code is able to last a long time. The key idea is that software engineering is "programming integrated over time



#### Reflection and Action Items

I feel as software engineers we need to be mindful of how we decide to code our program. We need to think about the long term, our program is going to be used and maintained by people years after us. We must ensure that what we decide to do doesn't make life hard for the people after us. For example we should find a way to get the program to run on every OS.


#### FB2

This chapter talks about code coverage. Code coverage is measuring which parts of a program are actually executed during a test run. This is important because test your code will guarantee that your code works and seeing what happens during a test run can help you understand your code more and allows to make improvements.The book also talked about black box and white box testing. Black box fuzzing, also known as "blind fuzzing," is a testing technique where the tester has no knowledge of the internal structure or source code of the target software. Testers treat the software as a "black box" and focus solely on the inputs and outputs. Another way is called white box testing. White box fuzzing, also known as "smart fuzzing" or "code-aware fuzzing," involves testing a program with an understanding of its internal structure, such as the source code, algorithms, or data structures.


#### Action

The book gave some libaries to use for covering code. I think that this will be a big help when we want to go over our code





#### SE4

SE4 talks about the importace of working with people. The book emphasiszes that programming is not just about coding but it's also about working together.
The book gives some examples of famous people like Bill Gates or Linus. They didn't develop all of Linux or Microsoft on their own, they might have started
but they didn't do everything, they had a team to help them. This leads into the next topic "It's all about the team". In this part it talks about the three
pillars of social interaction humility, respect, and trust.

#### SE4 Refelction

After reading SE4, it's clear that we should all be mindful of how we communicate, especially when discussing someone else's code. If we come across as too critical, it can discourage the original coder from participating and make others hesitant to share their work for fear of harsh feedback. To create a more welcoming environment, we should aim for open and constructive discussions that encourage everyone to actively engage and improve together as a team.
